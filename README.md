# TryHackMe Writeups: Notes from the Terminal Trenches

**Welcome to the archive.**  
Here you’ll find my annotated walkthroughs, write-ups, and reflections from rooms I've completed on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). This repo is a blend of technical breakdowns, threat-hunting rituals, bash sorcery, and post-incident meditations.

Expect:
- Markdown autopsies of hacking labs
- Blue Team detection writeups
- Screenshots, sample logs, and tools
- Lessons learned and things I’d do differently
- Occasional zine-style PDFs for print-and-hack purists

> “Study the exploit. Map the logs. Filter the noise. Repeat.”  
> — Terminal mantra from the *Blizzard of Firewalls* era

## Structure

Each folder or file is named after the room. Inside, you'll find:
- **`<room>.md`** — full write-up, sanitized and annotated
- **Screenshots/** — key moments from the room (if allowed)
- **Tools/** — any original scripts or command references
- **PDFs/** — printable zine versions for IR binder warriors
